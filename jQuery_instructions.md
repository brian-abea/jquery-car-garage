# Sourcing jQuery

In order to use jQuery, we need to include it in our project. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Inside the `scripts` folder in your assignment, add a new file called `jQuery.js`.

2. In your browser, go to `http://jquery.com/download/`. There are a couple different versions of jQuery available to download. We are going to use the *uncompressed, development* version.

3. Click on the link for the *uncompressed, development* version of jQuery. You will be brought to a page with a ton of code in it! You don't need to be able to read this code. 

4. Press `CMD+S`, and save the file to your project folder

5. Source this file in your HTML using a `<script>` tag. It needs to be sourced *above* your client.js file, or else it won't work correctly. Remember that this file is inside the `scripts` folder!
